# Rust Refinement

## Usage

Use `cargo build` and `cargo run` to build and see the failing output.

Use `cargo flux` to see the compliation errors due to the refinement types.

## Dependencies

Use the `install.sh` script to install flux, liquid-fixpoint, and a SMT theorem solver. This script also installs GHC and cabal if they are missing from your system, as they are needed to install liquid-fixpoint.
